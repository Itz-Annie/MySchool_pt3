                <p>Crookfur marked Fairtrade Fortnight with pupils from P5/6, P6A and P6B sharing their 
                    learning at assembly. These classes have been learning about Fairtrade this term and 
                    told us all about different Fairtrade products, how Fairtrade benefits farmers and 
                    workers, and what we can do to help support Fairtrade. As a result of their excellent 
                    work, Crookfur has achieved the FairAware Award which we hope to build on in the future. </p>

                <p>Two of our Primary 6 pupils who competed in the
                    Glasgow Science Festival: Cluster K’nex Challenge.
                    
                    They had visited Eastwood High School to compete against other
                    schools in our cluster. This challenge involved working together to build a theme park
                    ride in a one hour time frame. The ride had to be 30cm tall, have six seats and be able
                    to move which the team managed to achieve by making a Ferris wheel.
                    
                    They received some excellent feedback from the judges including the fact
                    they communicated well throughout the whole task and overcame any challenges that
                    they faced.</p>
